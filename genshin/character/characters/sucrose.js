export const playstyle = 'Sucrose is a 4-star anemo catalyst user that is capable of amazing elemental mastery sharing, ' +
    'good swirl damage, and decent Crowd Control. Whether as a DPS-role or an EM-support bot role, Sucroseâ€™s abilities ' +
    'shine brightest when your team composition is able to bring forth frequent element applications and whose main ' +
    'source of damage is reaction damage. Not to mention, having a 2-charge elemental AOE skill (at C1) and DoT AOE ' +
    'burst will always keep multiple light/mid-weighted enemies in a crowd for your other teammates to secure a solid ' +
    'swipe. However, as an anemo-catalyst user, Sucrose will suffer against enemies who have anemo status or immunity ' +
    'to their own element, meaning slimes will be very tough to strike down without a proper team composition. In ' +
    'addition, most her potential shines when she reaches C1, making her one of the most F2P friendly 4-star options.';
