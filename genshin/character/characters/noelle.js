export const story = 'Like most of Mondstadt\'s young people, Noelle always dreamed of being a knight of Favonius when ' +
    'she grew up. She may not have what it takes to be a knight just yet, but she is learning. Working as a maid at the ' +
    'Knights\' headquarters, she is constantly taking notes on what constitutes knightly speech, knightly conduct, and ' +
    'knightly customs. She holds firm to her belief that one day she will join their ranks â€” she just needs to keep ' +
    'trying her hardest at everything she does.';

export const playstyle = 'If you want to use Noelle as a Main DPS, it is recommended to have Noelle at C6: <b>Must Be ' +
    'Spotless</b>! <b>[Sweeping Time increases Noelle\'s ATK by an additional 50% of her DEF. Additionally, every ' +
    'opponent defeated during the skill\'s duration adds 1s to the duration, up to 10s.]</b><br><br>If you are using ' +
    'Noelle with the 4-<i class="twa twa-star"></i> Claymore: <b>Whiteblind</b>, Noelle must hit enemies 4 times before ' +
    'triggering her Elemental Burst, each hit adds one more DEF-stack from its Refinement passive!';
